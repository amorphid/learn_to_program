# # Deaf grandma extended. What if Grandma doesnâ€™t want you to leave? When you
# # shout BYE, she could pretend not to hear you. Change your previous program so
# # that you have to shout BYE three times in a row. Make sure to test your
# # program: if you shout BYE three times but not in a row, you should still be
# # talking to Grandma.
