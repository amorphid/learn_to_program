# Improved ask method.

# That ask method I showed you was OK, but I bet you could do better. Try to
# clean it up by removing the answer variable. Youâ€™ll have to use return to
# exit from the loop. (Well, it will get you out of the whole method, but it
# will get you out of the loop in the process.) How do you like the resulting
# method? I usually try to avoid using return (a personal preference), but I
# might make an exception here.
