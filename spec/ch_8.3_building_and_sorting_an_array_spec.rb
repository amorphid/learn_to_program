# Building and sorting an array.

# Write the program we talked about at the beginning of this chapter, one that
# asks us to type as many words as we want (one word per line, continuing until
# we just press Enter on an empty line) and then repeats the words back to us
# in alphabetical order. Make sure to test your program thoroughly; for
# example, does hitting Enter on an empty line always exit your program? Even
# on the first line? And the second? Hint: Thereâ€™s a lovely array method that
# will give you a sorted version of an array: sort. Use it!
